### Hola ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavogel/mavogel/master/assets/xw.png" width="260">

I'm Manuel, an open-source enthusiast, active contributor and automation lover. I'm not an author of my own project 
yet but a maintainer of a bunch of projects. When I see something to be improved, I just do it. When I see a project
which simplifies my life and the one of many others I use my skills to improve it even more.

Curious what I've been hacking on recently or what I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128554892-manuel-vogel)?
