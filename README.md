### Hola <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm Manuel, an open-source enthusiast, active contributor, and automation lover.

### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source. I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule. 
When I see something to be improved, I do it. When I see a project
that simplifies my life and many others. I use my skills to improve it even more.
I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with. 
This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.  
I üíï a good onboarding readme with good example.
